# MUTE POLICE_SCANNER for GTA V #

Are you sick of hearing your crimes announced over the police radio as you flee? 
Maybe you have stolen a police car and don't want to listen all day about how "busy" the police are while not looking for you (thief)... 

Or maybe, like me, you use LSPDFR along with some other AI police scanner (such as More Radio Chatter, xScanner or Ambient AI Callouts and the default police scanner is still jabbering away in the background spoling that immersive experience. 

Well, have I got a QoL mod for you (that you didn't realise you needed):

**MUTE Police_Scanner** simply replaces (not one, not two, but all) of the audio files used by the in-game police scanner with silent audio. That's right - silence (kind of). This means while it is still technically playing in the background - it is muted (well, almost). 

This only affects the in game scanner (unless there is a mod out there making use of these files directly) so it will: 
- Turn off the background chatter you hear sitting in police cars
- Turn off the dispach / police updates if YOU are wanted by the police

This will NOT affect the audio in LSPDFR, or any callout packs as they use the asudio files installed by LSPDFR. 

**Known limitations:**
- You will still hear the beeps and squelch noise when the scanner triggers audio. As soon as I can find these audio files I will provide an update to turn these off as well. Do you know where they are? If so, please get in touch!
- There is a (very) small possibility that some clever mod developer found a way to use this audio dierect out of the game rather than the LSPDFR Audio folder (maybe, I guess?) which will, of course mute that audio too.

**Prerequisites:**
OpenIV and a "mods" folder in your game folder

**Installation:**
1. Copy the mods folder from the zip file into your mods folder in your "Grand Theft Auto V" installation directory. 

**Removal:**
If you installed it correctly, you just need to go to Grand Theft Auto V --> mods --> x64 --> audio --> sfx and delete POLICE_SCANNER.RPF

**Version history:**
1.0.0
- Initial release
